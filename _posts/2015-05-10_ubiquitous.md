# Ubiquitous

Today I want to focus on a particularly useful word.  Ubiquitous is an important word. It means “commonplace” but I like to reserve it to describe things so commonplace they are overlooked. David Foster Wallace introduces the idea with a short story.

> There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”

Our bodies filter persistent stimuli. That is why I only feel a shirt when I first put it on, and why the recovering deaf must train their brain to filter out background noise. So it is also with our minds.

How can we intentionally notice something that is so familiar we filter it out?  Some are highlighted when we consider alien contexts that don’t share those elements that are so common in ours we take them for granted.  The contexts might be physical locations, like other planets that accentuate how perfectly our Earth accommodates our fragile bodies.  The context might be social, like a culture with different fundamental values.  It can be internal, like the way different personalities think.  The testimony of previous generations help us pierce the veil of ubiquitous changes that blossom in time.

Ubiquitous plays an important role in many concepts I hope to write about here.  I write this introduction so I can link back to it in future posts.
