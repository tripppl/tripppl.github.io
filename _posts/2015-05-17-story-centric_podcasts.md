# Story-centric Podcasts

Here are a handful of the best podcasts I’ve found that consistently deliver emotionally loaded stories that subtly change my life.  I think of the number of these story gems as I glance over the titles and synopsis for new theater releases.  Note to movie executives: no need to scrape your exhausted franchises for sequels and reboots.  New quality content is plentiful.  You aren’t looking in the right place for it.  </soapbox>  Those podcasts are…

  * [The Moth](http://themoth.org/) – True stories told live without notes or props.  This is my favorite podcast.
  * [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast) – Ground breaking radio show features a mix of short stories, human interest stories, interviews, and in depth investigations.
  * [SNAP Judgement](http://snapjudgment.org/podcast) – I think of this as This American Life’s scrappy little brother.  No in depth reports.  More of the tales you’d like to hear at a meal among friends.
