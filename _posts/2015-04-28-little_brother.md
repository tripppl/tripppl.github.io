# Little Brother

I wager high school curriculum favor [1984](https://tripppl.github.io/2015/04/20/words_shape_thought.html) ([W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984), download, [buy](http://www.amazon.com/1984-Signet-Classics-George-Orwell/dp/0451524934/)) for the political message more than its storycraft.  Were that the case, I propose Cory Doctorow’s ([W](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow)) Little Brother ([W](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Brother_%28Doctorow_novel%29), [download](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/comment-page-12/), [buy](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765323117)) would be a far better choice.  It follows a handful of teenagers unwittingly caught in a government dragnet empowered by the Patriot Act after a terrorist bombing in the United States.

Fantastic fiction is well suited to explore thought experiments or make mundane ideas fresh.  Little Brother’s call to action is better served by remaining believable.  The setting is grounded.  It isn’t a totalitarian regime in the far future.  The powder kegs of potential ignited in this book are already in place today, and I would wager at least half our nation believes the catalyst is imminent.  The characters are grounded.  This is the plight of innocent people caught the dragnet of an authority with directives that supersede the civil rights we consider immutable.  The plot is grounded.  The stakes are smaller than most modern young adult fiction.  The band of teens is not likely to overthrow this government.  Let this book serve an as an example to other modern fiction writers.  It is the connection to characters and not the epic scope of the plot that draw readers to become invested in what is at stake.

The book is subversive, and not just politically.  The narrator is a teen.  His relationship with adults and government are very similar.  His teenage desires and values aren’t white washed either.  Such a sympathetic perspective inspires young minds, for better or worse.

The subversion extends beyond mere principles and into practice.  The book is peppered with essays about cryptography, networking and more.  The essays are an introduction for laymen.  They illustrate the real-world importance to every reader and pique latent curiosity in potential hobbyists and professionals.  The story requires the reader have some understanding of the topics in the essay.  The essay communicates it to the reader without relying on the dialog, which often hinder believable scenes.

The book is [free](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/).  It is published under creative commons.  It garnered mass praise from so many well respected authors.  I don’t understand why it didn’t catch on as fervently among actual teens.  I understand why adults might refrain from promoting it, but when has that hindered youth culture?

I figure I’d close with a quote by Eric Schmit, CEO of Google, in a 2009 interview with PC Magazine.  The emphasis is mine.

> If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place, but if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time, and it’s important, for example that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act. It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities.
